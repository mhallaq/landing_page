              Experience in project management refers to time spent planning,
              leading, directing, and managing projects. Planning:Created a
              blueprint that will guide the entire project from ideation to
              fruition, clarifying its scope, necessary resources, anticipated
              timeframe, communication strategy, and more. Leading: I have lead
              the project team through the process, Executing: I have engaged in
              the tangible activities required for moving the project forward.
              Time management: I have kept everyone on schedule and, when issues
              arise, are responsible for resolving them and communicating
              effectively with team members and other stakeholders. Budget: I

              project manager to manage them and reallocate resources where
              necessary.
